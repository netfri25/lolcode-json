HAI 1.4

CAN HAS PARSER?
CAN HAS FILE?

BTW the escape charactrer is ':' instead of '\', and for that reason I have to also escape the colon using a colon
OBTW TODO
    1. floating numbers support (currently only integers are supported
    2. string literals escaping
TLDR
I HAS A path ITZ "data.json"
I HAS A file ITZ FILE IZ OPEN YR path MKAY
I HAS A input ITZ FILE IZ GETZ YR file MKAY
I HAS A result ITZ PARSER IZ parse YR input MKAY
VISIBLE result IZ to_string MKAY

KTHXBYE
